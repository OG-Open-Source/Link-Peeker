## Overview

Link Peeker is a powerful Chromium extension designed to boost your browsing productivity. It allows you to preview the full, interactive content of any hyperlink in an elegant, centered, non-intrusive pop-up window without navigating away from your current page.

## Features

- **Full Webpage Preview:** Instead of just metadata, Link Peeker loads the complete, interactive webpage inside a sandboxed `<iframe>`.
- **Immersive UI:** The preview window appears centered on the screen with a semi-transparent, frosted-glass effect overlay.
- **Advanced Theming System:**
  - **Built-in Themes:** Comes with polished, hard-coded Light and Dark themes.
  - **Visual Theme Editor:** A powerful editor in the settings page allows you to create, edit, and delete your own custom themes.
  - **Detailed Customization:** Adjust everything from background/button colors to primary/secondary text colors, error message colors, and even enable/disable and control the intensity of the Gaussian blur effect.
  - **Import & Export:** Easily share your creations by exporting themes to a JSON file, or import themes created by others.
- **Intelligent YouTube Handling:**
  - Previews the full, interactive YouTube page (including comments) when navigating within YouTube.
  - Automatically switches to the embeddable player when previewing a YouTube link from any other website to ensure maximum compatibility.
- **Fluid Animations:** Powered by GSAP for smooth, high-performance animations for the window, overlay, and loading indicators.
- **Comprehensive Security Configuration:** A dedicated options page with a clean sidebar navigation allows you to configure:
  - **General:** Set your preferred trigger key (`Alt`, `Ctrl`, or `Shift`).
  - **Appearance:** Select a theme or use the visual editor to create your own.
  - **Rules:** Define custom rules to remove restrictive headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`) for specific domains.
  - **Advanced:** Fine-tune security settings like `Sandbox Permissions`, `Feature Policy`, and `Referrer Policy`.
- **Modern & Secure:** Built with Manifest V3 and uses `declarativeNetRequest` to surgically bypass anti-framing headers on specific domains like YouTube, without compromising overall security.

## Glossary

- **Manifest V3:** The current standard for Chrome extensions, focusing on improved security, performance, and privacy.
- **declarativeNetRequest:** A Manifest V3 API that allows extensions to modify network requests declaratively. Used here to remove anti-framing headers for specific domains.
- **Shadow DOM:** A web standard used for CSS encapsulation. It creates a "shadow root" for an element, isolating its styles and structure from the main document's DOM.
- **sandbox (iframe attribute):** A security feature that applies a set of restrictions to the content within an `<iframe>`.
- **allow (iframe attribute):** A Feature Policy mechanism that allows you to selectively enable specific browser features within the `<iframe>`.
